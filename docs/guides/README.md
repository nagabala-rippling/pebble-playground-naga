## 🧩 Components

**Question:** "What props does X accept? How do I use this component?"

📍 **Location:** [`components/`](./components/)

### What's Here
- Individual Pebble component documentation
- Component API reference (props, variants, sizes)
- When to use / when not to use
- Accessibility requirements
- Code examples
- Visual examples and Figma links

### Examples
- [`button.md`](./components/buttons/button.md) - Button props, appearances, sizes
- [`modal.md`](./components/modal.md) - Modal variants and best practices
- [`drawer.md`](./components/drawer.md) - Drawer usage and configuration

### When to Use
✅ Learning a new component  
✅ Looking up component props/API  
✅ Understanding component variants  
✅ Finding component examples

---

## 🧭 Patterns

**Question:** "How do I solve X?"

📍 **Location:** [`patterns/`](./patterns/)

### What's Here
- Generic UX problem-solving approaches
- Guided defaults for common scenarios
- Decision trees for choosing components
- Accessibility checklists
- Could theoretically apply outside Rippling

### Examples
- **Snackbar Feedback** - "How do I show success/error messages?"
- **Form Validation** - "How do I validate form input?"
- **Blocking Confirmation** - "How do I confirm destructive actions?"

### When to Use
✅ Solving a specific interaction problem  
✅ Choosing between component options  
✅ Implementing a common UX pattern  
✅ Ensuring accessibility compliance

### Pattern Types
1. **Feedback patterns** - Snackbars, notices, modals
2. **Form patterns** - Validation, multi-step flows
3. **Navigation patterns** - Tabs, breadcrumbs, drawers
4. **Data patterns** - Empty states, loading states, errors

## 🏗️ Building Blocks

**Question:** "How do I build Y in Rippling?"

📍 **Location:** [`building-blocks/`](./building-blocks/)

### What's Here
- Rippling-specific composite UX modules
- Platform conventions and constraints
- Feature-level guidance
- Combines multiple components + business logic
- Complete systems, not just individual interactions

### Examples
- **Responsive Strategy** - "What are our breakpoints? How do we handle mobile?"
- **Dashboards** - "How do I build a dashboard in Rippling?"
- **Workflow Automator** - "How does the workflow builder work?"

### When to Use
✅ Prototyping a new Rippling feature  
✅ Understanding platform constraints  
✅ Building composite experiences  
✅ Implementing known Rippling patterns  
✅ Need business logic context

### Building Block Types
1. **Layout systems** - Responsive strategy, grid patterns
2. **Complex features** - Dashboards, workflow automator
3. **Platform conventions** - Navigation shells, data display

**[→ Full Building Blocks Guide](./building-blocks/README.md)**

## 🧠 Platform Context

**Question:** "How does Rippling work?"

📍 **Location:** [`platform-context/`](./platform-context/)

### What's Here
- Business logic and product requirements
- Data models and relationships
- User roles and permissions
- Common workflows and use cases
- Platform architecture and concepts

### Examples
- **User Roles** - "What can a manager do vs an admin?"
- **Data Models** - "What fields does an Employee have?"
- **Common Use Cases** - "How does time-off approval work?"
- **Platform Overview** - "How is Rippling different from point solutions?"

### When to Use
✅ Understanding Rippling-specific business logic  
✅ Learning user roles and permissions  
✅ Designing features with realistic constraints  
✅ Prototyping with actual data structures  
✅ Understanding cross-module workflows

### Documentation Types
1. **Platform Overview** - High-level architecture, unified platform concept
2. **User Roles** - Manager, Admin, Employee permissions
3. **Data Models** - Employee, Department, TimeOffRequest entities
4. **Common Use Cases** - Onboarding, approvals, dashboards

**[→ Full Platform Context Guide](./platform-context/README.md)**

## 🤖 For AI Assistants

### Prototyping Workflow

When helping a user prototype a Rippling feature:

1. **Understand the request**
   - Is it a component question? → `components/`
   - Is it a UX problem? → `patterns/`
   - Is it a feature? → `building-blocks/`

2. **Layer the context**
   ```
   Platform Context (business logic & data)
   ↓
   Building Block (feature scope)
   ↓
   Pattern (interaction)
   ↓
   Component (implementation)
   ```

3. **Example layering**
   ```
   User: "Create a manager dashboard to approve time off"
   
   → Platform Context: user-roles.md, common-use-cases.md, data-models.md
     (Manager permissions, approval workflow, TimeOffRequest data)
   
   → Building Block: dashboards.md
     (Grid layout, card types, responsive)
   
   → Pattern: snackbar-feedback
     (Show approval confirmation)
   
   → Components: button.md, cards.md, modal.md
     (Approve button, time off card, approval modal)
   ```

### Best Practices

✅ **Start broad, get specific** - Platform context → building blocks → patterns → components  
✅ **Understand business logic first** - Check platform-context before designing UIs  
✅ **Cross-reference** - Patterns reference components, building blocks reference patterns  
✅ **Follow Rippling conventions** - Don't invent patterns, use documented ones  
✅ **Check accessibility** - Every pattern includes a11y checklists  
✅ **Use real data models** - Reference actual entities from platform-context
